    "content": "## Introduction to XSS\n\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy.\n\n### Types of XSS Attacks\n\n1.  **Reflected XSS:** The injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as part of the request.\n2.  **Stored XSS:** The injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, a visitor log, a comment field, etc. The victim then retrieves the malicious script from the server when it requests the stored information.\n3.  **DOM-based XSS:** The vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than the server-side code. The attacker's payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM environment in the victim's browser."

    "content": "## Understanding SQL Injection\n\nSQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. SQL Injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques. SQLi is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.\n\n### Example of an attack\n\nWhen a user provides input, that input can be manipulated to include SQL commands. For example, a login form might be vulnerable. An attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` in the password field to bypass authentication."

    "content": "## React vs. Vue\n\nChoosing between React and Vue for your next project can be a tough decision. Both are powerful, popular, and have strong communities.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n*   **Learning Curve:** Vue is often considered easier to pick up than React, thanks to its more traditional templating syntax.\n*   **Flexibility:** React is a library, offering more flexibility and requiring you to make more choices about things like routing and state management. Vue is a framework that is more opinionated but provides more out-of-the-box.\n*   **Performance:** Both offer excellent performance, with virtual DOM implementations. Performance differences are often negligible for most applications."

When combined with a framework like Express, you can build robust APIs quickly.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n*   **Asynchronous Code:** Embrace `async/await` to handle asynchronous operations cleanly.\n*   **Middleware:** Use middleware for concerns like authentication, logging, and error handling.\n*   **Environment Variables:** Never hardcode configuration. Use a tool like `dotenv` to manage environment-specific settings."
